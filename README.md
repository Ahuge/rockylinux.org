# Rocky Linux Gatsby Project
If you're here, you may have seen my streams around migrating the Rocky Linux website (rockylinux.org) to Gatsby. Below you'll find a checklist of tasks that have been completed and what is still left to do. Contributions are encouraged!

## To Do
- [X] News Posts
- [ ] Press Page and Content
- [X] Sponsors Page
- [ ] Localization (i18n)
- [ ] Remove unnecessary fluff from starter project (partially done)
- [ ] Implement re-used content to components

## Start Development Server
1. Install dependencies via NPM.

```bash
npm i
```
2. Start the development server.
```bash
gatsby develop
```
