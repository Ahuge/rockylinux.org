Theodore Ts’o has joined the Rocky Enterprise Software Foundation’s Board of Directors. 

On June 10, 2023, the membership of the Rocky Enterprise Software Foundation (RESF) voted to approve Theodore Ts’o as an At-Large Director of the RESF Board, effective immediately. The bylaws of the RESF incorporate At-Large Directors on the Board in order to ensure a breadth of perspectives from the greater open-source community. 

“I am looking forward to this opportunity to be part of the Rocky Enterprise Linux Foundation,” says Ts’o. “Enterprise Linux provides immense value to individuals and businesses of the open source community.” 

Since his graduation from the MIT computer science program in 1990, Ts’o has worked in the Linux community, being instrumental in the Kerberos project and the /dev/random Linux device node. He is a Debian developer whose work experience includes MIT, IBM, and Google.

Ts’o has a history of advocacy for open-source software. In 2006 he was presented the Award for the Advancement of Free Software by the Free Software Foundation. Starting in 2007 he held a two-year fellowship with the Linux Foundation, serving as a Chief Platform Specialist and later Chief Technology Officer. He has also been a member, including holding leadership positions, of the Internet Engineering Task Force, the IPsec Working Group, and the Free Standards Group. 

The RESF is an organizational body designed to help open-source projects thrive with a structure that ensures a balanced and fair distribution of community control while specifically enabling enterprise use-cases, vendors, and commercial entities. We look forward to Mr. Ts’o’s perspectives and influence to support the communities of Rocky Linux as well as other open source projects, both current and future, within the RESF.
