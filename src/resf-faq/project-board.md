Each Project Board exists under the RESF (Foundation) Board and there can be any number of Project Teams beneath it. Each Project Board will have a chair and a vice-chair on the RESF board for a single vote. This provides a top level RESF Board structure which has representation and board visibility to all Projects within the Foundation. This creates a system of checks and balances in the RESF Board proper as well as between the Project Boards.

Project boards are subject to the RESF board but are responsible for the governance of their own Project Teams which are subject to their respective Project Board.
