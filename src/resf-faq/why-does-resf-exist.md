title: Why does the Rocky Enterprise Software Foundation (RESF) exist?
posttype: 'resf-faq'
---

What weâ€™ve created with the RESF is an organizational body designed to help open source projects thrive with a structure that ensures a balanced and fair distribution of community control while specifically enabling enterprise use-cases, vendors, and commercial entities. Our charter and bylaws set forth an inclusive management framework, commitment, and accountability to ensure the longevity and success of our hosted open source projects and their respective communities.

Our vision is to create and nurture a community of individuals and organizations that are committed to ensuring the longevity, stewardship, and innovation of enterprise grade/class open source software that is always freely available.

We invite all individuals and organizations who believe in this vision to stand with us and be part of this Foundation and Projects.
