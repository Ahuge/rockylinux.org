RESF Members have several responsibilities to the RESF and Projects, one of those is to nominate, second, and vote for the board seats. It is important for the RESF that all elections are done via RESF Members, the people who are working directly on the RESF Projects and Project Teams to ensure that the best candidates are elected to board positions.

We strive for a meritocracy, so under no circumstances will board seats or votes be sold to the highest bidders. Everyone who has been elected to these seats are there because the Project Members believe they belong there and all Members can be eligible for leadership positions.

These elections will occur every two years.
