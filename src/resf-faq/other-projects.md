Yes, absolutely! The RESF was created to do much more than just Rocky Linux. No association required with Rocky Linux is necessary to join the RESF and new Projects are in formation. Projects do not even need to be Linux-related, but they must be open source under an OSI approved license with a preference towards non-copyleft.

The RESF welcomes any open source projects that need a neutral ground to operate.
