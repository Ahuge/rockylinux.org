title: Is the RESF and Rocky Linux the same thing?
posttype: 'resf-faq'

The RESF is a legal entity that hosts open source projects (such as Rocky Linux).

At the time of this writing, Rocky Linux is the main project and focus of the RESF, but we hope to join with more open source projects that are aligned with our vision and provide resources, structure, and support to them.
