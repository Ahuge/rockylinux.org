Unlike many open source foundations, the RESF does not believe in “selling”  board seats or votes. All Board Members deserve to be there based on merit, elected by their peers within the community, not who can afford the largest donation.

This means that all boards (both the RESF Board and Project Boards) are composed of the active contributors (a.k.a. RESF Members) and elected by other RESF Members annually.

The RESF Board additionally will have a given number of “At-Large” Directors who are not necessarily RESF Members, but independents, who the RESF Members feel will help with the RESF and Project’s success and leadership. Board seats are unpaid, however, the RESF Board is responsible for the Project funds, and may elect to pay modest compensation for particular services.

All board seats will go through a process of the Members nominating and seconding a nomination to make board candidates eligible. All board candidates will then be voted on by the Members equal to the number of seats that are open. For example, if there are 3 seats open, each Member will get three votes (one vote for each seat), and the top three ranked nominees will take those seats in no particular order.

To be eligible for a Board seat, you must be at least 18 years of age, have been a member for at least one year, demonstrated exemplary dedication and support of the Project, and have invited/mentored at least one person within the last 12 month period.
