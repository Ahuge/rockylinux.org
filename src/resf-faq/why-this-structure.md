The RESF structure is different from other open source foundations only in that it takes what we feel is the best of each and brings them together into a unique structure. You will find similarities among all of those listed, and our uniqueness is based on how we mixed everything together and superimposed this structure on top of how we basically operate today while striving to achieve a balance between community and the needs of enterprise organizations.
