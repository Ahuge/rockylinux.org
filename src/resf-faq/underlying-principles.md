Our guiding principles are: community responsibility, management, and control; ensuring that all dependencies, sources, and build artifacts are free, open source and reproducible; being receptive to adopt and support other projects within the open source community with similar values; transparency in our decision making,  organization, and development; enablement of commercial interests in a way that creates a positive feedback loop back into sustainable open source projects and commercialization; and lastly growth and equality of opportunity for individuals and organizations, everyone is welcome.

Each of these principles are elaborated on within Article II of our charter.
